# :books: Mekjátszó

### Directory Structure

- :wrench: `scraper`: This directory contains the Python project for scraping data from **Magyar Elektronikus Könyvtár**'s page. The scraper collects data of audio books and is used to populate the UI.

- :globe_with_meridians: `mek-scraper`: Inside this directory, you will find the source code for a static website. The website provides a user interface for listing and filtering the audio books collected by the scraper. It also includes a player for listening to the audio books.

- :page_facing_up: `docs`: The "docs" folder contains the built and deployed source code of the user interface. This is the final version of the website that users can access and interact with.
